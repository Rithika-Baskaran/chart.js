# chart.js

Chart.js is a powerful data visualization library. Weâ€™re going to create a simple pie chart by setting type to pie and visualizing the world population during the last 500 years. We create both html (index.html) and javascript file (script.js) . We use the cdnjs (content delivery network) library and then we use the canvas element to set the proportions of the pie chart. Finally we prepare a data and put it in script.js. We get the pie chart.
